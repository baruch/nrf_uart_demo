NRF24LE1 UART Demo
==================

This is a demo program to show the use of an nRF24LE1 UART device with the SDCC SDK https://github.com/DeanCording/nRF24LE1_SDK

I was testing this with the serial pins connected to an Arduino clone called
the minion which is a Leonardo compatible device and I used pins D0 and D1 as
the serial pins on the Leonardo with the Serial1 class to read and write the
serial port.
